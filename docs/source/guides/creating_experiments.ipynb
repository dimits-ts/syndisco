    "# Creating and Managing Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two guides showcased how you can create and run synthetic discussions, and synthetic annotations using LLMs. However, in order to produce robust results for a hypothesis, you may need to produce multiple annotated discussions. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is certainly possible using the `Discussion` and `Annotation` APIs, SynDisco offers the `Experiment` high-level API which automatically creates and manages multiple discussions with different configurations. An`Experiment` is an entity that generates and runs `jobs`. Thus, if we want to generate and run 100 `Discussion` jobs, we would use a `DiscussionExperiment`. Likewise, if we want to annotate those 100 discussions, we would use an `AnnotationExperiment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will showcase how you can leverage this API to automate your experiments. You will also learn how to utilize SynDisco's built-in logging functions as well as how to export your datasets in CSV format for convenience. "
